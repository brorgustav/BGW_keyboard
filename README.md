www.synthbror.com Keyboard library for making musical/midi instrument, modified library of https://github.com/Chris--A/Keypad

I ripped apart alot of MIDI keyboards to steal the keybed, i will try to fill this library with different models and their pinouts
Examples: M-Audio axiom32 AiR mini - velocity sensitive and sending USBMIDI http://synthbror.com/hacking-the-keyboard-of-m-audio-axiom-32/
